    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> While the packaged stuff is convenient, this flour tortilla recipe is so much better than store-bought.</p>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>        4 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 tbsp shortening,lard or butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all dry ingredients</li>
        <li>Crumble in the shortening/lard or butter</li>
        <li>Slowly begin to add the water, if your flour needs more water, add a little more, the flour should be hydrated</li>
        <li>Knead for 5 minutes or until the flour doesnâ€™t stick to your hands</li>
        <li>Divide dough into even balls(88g) to get 12</li>
        <li>Cover and allow to rest for 15-20 minutes</li>
        <li>Dust your clean countertop with flour, grab a ball of dough, dust a little more flour and begin to roll. Roll up down then rotate , up down rotate and continue doing this until the dough has stretched to your desired size</li>
        <li>On a hot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comal_(cookware)">comal</a> over medium heat place the rolled out tortilla and cook until it begins to blister, flip over and allow it to puff no longer than 30 seconds! Overcooking it will give you hard tostadas</li>
        <li>Place in a kitchen towel and repeat until you no longer have any more dough to roll out</li>
    </ol>
